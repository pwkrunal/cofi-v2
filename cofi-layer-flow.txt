Read say 10000 files from client directory (read from .env) eg. /client_volume/<batch_date> and batch date format id 15-12-2024
Except 2 files rest files are audio files
These 2 files are CSV named as callMetadata.csv and tradeMetadata.csv
Audio files are to be distributed among n gpu machines(read from .env) to a specific directory save a copy in fileDistribution table
Mark dbInserstatus Completed
Cofi running on CPU machine has to start docker of ivr(read from .env) on these n gpus and wait for 60 seconds(read from .env) 
Then we hit ivr api on these n gpus with payload just give filename and response is not of use now
Mark ivrStatus Completed
Then we stop ivr docker and start lid docker
Then we hit lid ap ion these n gpus with payload just give filename and response tostore in lidStatus table
Mark lidStatus Completed
Stop lid docker
Use this lidStatus table and insert data into call table 
Then we start stt docker and wait for 180 seconds 
Then hit stt docker with api (read from .env) using call table status = ‘Pending’ on these n gpus mark in call table status = ‘TranscriptDone’
Mark sttStatus Completed
Then we start llm1 docker and wait for 180 seconds
Then hit llm1 docker api (read from .env) using call table status = ‘TranscriptDone’ on these n gpus and mark in call table status = ‘AuditDone’
Mark llmStatus1 Completed
Then we start llm2 docker and wait for 180 seconds
Then hit llm2 docker api (read from .env) using call table status = ‘AuditDone’ on these n gpus and mark in call table status = ‘Completed’
Mark llmStatus2 Completed
Docker names to start and stop which are in network  keep in env (read from .env)
Pre requisite assume batchDate and currentBatch = 1 to identify which batch to start
Update status accordingly in batchStatus table
Using batchStatus and fileDistribution we can keep track which file has completed what, even some error comes we can resume operations from there
